Description:	Enable/disable demoting pages during reclaim

		Page migration during reclaim is intended for systems
		with tiered memory configurations.  These systems have
		multiple types of memory with varied performance
		characteristics instead of plain NUMA systems where
		the same kind of memory is found at varied distances.
		Allowing page migration during reclaim enables these
		systems to migrate pages from fast tiers to slow tiers
		when the fast tier is under pressure.  This migration
		is performed before swap.  It may move data to a NUMA
		node that does not fall into the cpuset of the
		allocating process which might be construed to violate
		the guarantees of cpusets.  This should not be enabled
		on systems which need strict cpuset location
		guarantees.

Description:	Enable/disable promoting pages during file access

		Page migration during file access is intended for systems
		with tiered memory configurations that have significant
		unmapped file cache usage. By default, file cache memory
		on slower tiers will not be opportunistically promoted by
		normal NUMA hint faults, because the system has no way to
		track them.  This option enables opportunistic promotion
		of pages that are accessed via syscall (e.g. read/write)
		if multiple accesses occur in quick succession.

		It may move data to a NUMA node that does not fall into
		the cpuset of the allocating process which might be
		construed to violate the guarantees of cpusets.  This
		should not be enabled on systems which need strict cpuset
		location guarantees.
